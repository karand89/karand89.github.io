### A function that will plot a players shots over a season on an NHL rink

This function is based on a .csv file that I uploaded, however, if you were to create your own csv you can still run the function as long as it uses the same inputs as the function calls for. 


```python
#import pandas for dataframes 
import pandas as pd

#function requires both matplot and seaborn imported to create the rink shot heatmap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

%matplotlib inline

#csv file I used
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_df_formodelling.csv')
```


```python
#A function to that plots shots over a season by a specific player in a heatmap over an NHL rink to visualize
#where players are shooting and scoring from (the heatmap is darker in regions where goals are scored)


def shotPlot(year, player):
    
    '''
    This function was designed as part of my capstone project to visualize where individual players are shooting from.
    
    A .csv file is required for it to work. Anyone can use it, as long as their csv is based on 
    shot events over the course of a season. It must include a column defining the season, a players full name, 
    goals scored (if scored on that particular shot event), and coordinates adjusted to one side of a rink for easy 
    plotting. 
    
    
    The rink was downloaded from google and is included on my gitpage. 
    '''
    
    
    #right now the dataframe is built based on a csv file I created - this csv is not avail on my git page because it 
    #is too large
    df1 = df.loc[df['season']==year]
    df1 = df1.loc[df1['shooterName']==player]
   
    #Define the plot
    def plottedRink(df,player,year):
    
        #get the rink image (this file is also included on my gitpage)
        image = '../images/hrink.png'
        im = plt.imread(image)

        #create the cmap
        cmap = sns.cubehelix_palette(start=df['goal'].mean(),light=1,as_cmap=True,dark = 0.4)
        plt.figure(figsize=(15,15))

        #create the kdeplot (heatmap)
        hmax = sns.kdeplot(data=df['xCordAdjusted'],data2=df['yCordAdjusted'],cmap=cmap,cbar=True,shade=True,bw=0.8)
        
        #set this as alpha
        hmax.collections[0].set_alpha(0)

        #the rink displayed and the borders are defined to ensure the coordinates are properly plotted
        implot = plt.imshow(im, zorder=0, extent=(-20,110,-42,43))

    
        plt.title(f'Shot Heatmap of {player} in {year}',{'fontsize': 30,'fontweight' : 300})
        plt.show()
    
    return plottedRink(df1,player,year)
    
    
```


```python
shotPlot(2017,'Alex Ovechkin')
```
